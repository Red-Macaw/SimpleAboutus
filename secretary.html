                    <p>At DAV, we aim to provide our children holistic education, focusing on the four Cs - Communication, Collaboration, Creativity and Critical thinking.
                        Known for our academic rigour, we are deeply conscious about ensuring that our children grow up as ardent patriots, develop a strong spiritual framework, are service-oriented thus developing a sense of compassion and learn to enjoy sports though all of them need not become great players.
                        We take pride in the ancient gurukul system and believe that teachers are truly special - आचार्य देवो भवः| We may not have the best of modern infrastructure (some aspects by conscious choice and some due to genuine constraints), but we are proud to have the best of teachers.
                        We envision our children evolve into empowered individuals who can contribute to the world as leaders, overcome the challenges of life through spiritual strength and guide themselves, their families and societies to peace and happiness.</p>
